Page 1 provides an interactive visual summary of UPI transaction activity by month.
The report allows users to switch between different chart views depending on their analysis needs.

🔁 Dynamic Chart Switching
Users can toggle between multiple visual formats using bookmark-based buttons:

Data Metric	Available Views
Amount	Line Chart & Column Chart
Remaining Balance	Line Chart & Column Chart

This feature allows users to explore the dataset from different perspectives — whether they prefer trend-based visuals (line charts) or comparative month-to-month values (column charts).

💱 Multi-Currency Filtering

The dataset includes transactions in four different currencies:
- USD
- EUR
- GBP
- INR

Users can select the desired currency from the Filter Pane to view metrics consistently in one unit.
This ensures that comparisons remain accurate and meaningful without currency-value confusion.

🎚 Interactive Filters

Additional slicers are available to refine insights by:
- Bank (Sender & Receiver)
- City
- Device Type
- Gender & Age Group
- Merchant Name
- Payment Method
- Purpose
- Transaction Type

These filters make the report highly adaptable for exploratory and targeted analysis.
