Page 1 provides an interactive visual summary of UPI transaction activity by month.
The report allows users to switch between different chart views depending on their analysis needs.

🔁 Dynamic Chart Switching
Users can toggle between multiple visual formats using bookmark-based buttons:

Data Metric	Available Views
Amount	Line Chart & Column Chart
Remaining Balance	Line Chart & Column Chart

This feature allows users to explore the dataset from different perspectives — whether they prefer trend-based visuals (line charts) or comparative month-to-month values (column charts).

💱 Multi-Currency Filtering

The dataset includes transactions in four different currencies:
- USD
- EUR
- GBP
- INR

Users can select the desired currency from the Filter Pane to view metrics consistently in one unit.
This ensures that comparisons remain accurate and meaningful without currency-value confusion.

🎚 Interactive Filters

Additional slicers are available to refine insights by:
- Bank (Sender & Receiver)
- City
- Device Type
- Gender & Age Group
- Merchant Name
- Payment Method
- Purpose
- Transaction Type

These filters make the report highly adaptable for exploratory and targeted analysis.

This page presents a monthly breakdown of transaction amounts and remaining balances across major cities including Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai. The table allows users to compare financial activities by currency (EUR, USD, GBP, INR) and month, making it easier to analyze spending patterns, and transaction distribution throughout the year. Interactive slicers at the top enable filtering based on criteria such as bank name, city, device type, gender, merchant, payment method, and more, providing a tailored and detailed view of financial data.
